        "Data encoding is the process of converting categorical (non-numeric) data into a numeric format so that Machine Learning models can understand and use it. Most ML algorithms work only with numbers, so encoding is necessary when your dataset contains labels like colors, names, categories, or yes/no values. There are several common encoding techniques. Label Encoding converts each category into a unique integer (for example, Red = 0, Blue = 1, Green = 2). It is simple but may accidentally introduce an order where none exists. One-Hot Encoding avoids this by creating separate binary columns for each category (e.g., Color_Red, Color_Blue, Color_Green), making it suitable for nominal data with no order. Ordinal Encoding is used when the categories have a natural order such as Low < Medium < High. Encoding helps algorithms interpret categorical features correctly and improves the performance of machine learning models."
