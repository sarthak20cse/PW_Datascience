        "Boosting works by training models sequentially. Each new model focuses more on the data points that were misclassified by previous models. By giving higher importance to difficult samples and combining the predictions of all models (usually through weighted voting or summation), boosting reduces bias and improves overall predictive performance."

XGBoost uses L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization on tree leaf weights, which discourages overly deep trees and large weights.
